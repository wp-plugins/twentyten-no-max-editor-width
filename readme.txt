=== TwentyTen: No Max Editor Width ===

Stable tag: 0.1

TwentyTen is a great new theme for WordPress, In my mind however, It suffers one fault, The TinyMCE editor is limited to just 640px content width. This is to allow you to get a visual indication of the layout of a post (For example, Floating images and text wraping). This plugin removes the ability for the theme to modify TinyMCE's content width.
